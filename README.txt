Ray Tracing
Computer Graphics, Spring 2015

The folder 'Bug Images' has all the images that, during the project, ended up with bugs.

The 'Program Files' folder has several other folders containing the programs I used to generate the images. The folders under the 'Program Files' are numbered from 1 to 7 and in that order I used these programs to make the images. Some of the initial programs I used to create the first images are no longer in existence as I modified the first programs to create the transitions between others, so only some of the steps have been saved.

The 'Project Images' file contains all the individual pictures I used to compile the video.

Finally, the final project is labeled 'GraphicsFinal.swf' and is just in the git directory.
